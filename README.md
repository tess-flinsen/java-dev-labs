# Developing Software Using Java - Laboratory Works

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory works for the course "Software developing using Java." Each lab work demonstrates various programming concepts and practices in Java, aimed to deepen the understanding of Java programming language. 

*All labs are done for Variant â„– 15.*

## Usage
Generally, to run each lab, do the following steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Choose the folder with the lab work needed.
4. Compile and run the Application file of that project.

*For specific usage instructions, see each lab description.*

### Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

--- 
### Lab Work 1: Arrays in Java

#### Overview
The first lab work implements basic matrix operations and is aimed to give understanding of array manipulation in Java.

#### Features
- Multiplication a matrix by a constant value (C5 = 15 % 5 = 0 => C = a * B).
- Finding the sum of the maximum elements in even-indexed rows (C11 = 15 % 11 = 4)
- Finding the sum of the minimum elements in odd-indexed rows. (C11 = 15 % 11 = 4)
- Exceptions handling for invalid inputs and overflow conditions.
- Matrix elements are of type byte (C7 = 15 % 7 = 1)


#### Usage
Change the matrix and the constant in the MatrixApplication file as needed, then save the file, recompile and run again to see the results in CLI.
